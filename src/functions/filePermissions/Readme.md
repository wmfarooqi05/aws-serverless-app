## File permissions

#### Email Incoming Handling
- Get All Attachments
- Get all embedded images
- Instead of file urls, maybe add file permissions key, (we can stick with url as file permission has url as unique)
- Upload content url, attachments and add to file permission
- In file permissions, send cc, bcc, to and from emails, from must be owner
- for thumbnail, keep things as it is
- in future, we will remove thumbnail from there and refer to file permissions
- for now, attach thumbnail url in file permissions.
- tell hassan that he will not receive thumbnail in array
- maybe fix this issue by handling this in getEmailById
